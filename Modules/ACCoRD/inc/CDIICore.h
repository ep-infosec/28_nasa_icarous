  /**
   * This class implements the core algorithms for conflict detection
   * between an ownship and a traffic aircraft trajectory, where both
   * trajectories include intent information.  This class assumes all
   * inputs are in internal units.  As such, this class is most
   * appropriate to be part of a larger system, not as a stand-alone
   * conflict detection algorithm.  For that functionality, see the
   * class CDII.<p>
   *
   * This class can be used two ways: through an object or through a
   * static method.  The static method approach has the advantage that
   * an object does not need to be created.  The object approach has the
   * advantage that more information is available.  Specifically, the
   * start and end times for every conflict are available in the object
   * approach. <p>
   *
   * When using the object method, all method getTimeIn(), etc, assume
   * that the detection() method has been called first.<p>
