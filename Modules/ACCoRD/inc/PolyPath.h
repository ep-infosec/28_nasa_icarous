/**
 * Polygons are arranged in "paths" similar to aircraft plans (and, in fact, this object can produce one 
 * -- or more -- faux-aircraft plans that approximate the area in question).  The polygon is allowed to 
 * change shape as it travels along the path, but the number of vertices must remain constant.  The shape
 * at non-specified time points is linearly interpolated from the neighboring points.   
 * 
 * (Note that the default mode has changed from MORPHING to AVG_VEL.)
 * 
 *  Paths can have one of several modes:
 *  AVG_VEL (the default): Velocities are calculated between the average points of consecutive steps.  Polygons do not need to have the
 *    same number of vertices at each step. The path starts to exist at the first time and stops existing at the last time.
 *    Vertical speed is based on the bottom of the steps. 
 *    In the case of a single-step path, velocity is zero and time is ignored: the polygon always exists statically at that location.
 *    The time interval the path exists is either [t1,t2] or [0,+inf] (for 1-step paths)
 *  MORPHING: all polygons must have the same number of vertices.  Velocities are calculated vertex by vertex between consecutive steps. 
 *    The path starts to exist at the first time and stops existing at the last time.
 *    Vertical speed is based on the bottom of the steps. 
 *    In the case of a single-step path, velocity is zero and time is ignored: the polygon always exists statically at that location.
 *    The time interval the path exists is either [t1,t2] or [0,+inf] (for 1-step paths)
 *  USER_VEL: Velocities are user-specified and applied to all vertices.  Polygons do not need to have the same number of vertices at each step.
 *    The path starts to exist at the first time, and the last step will have an infinitely continuing velocity.
 *    The time interval the path exists is always [t1,+inf]
 *  USER_VEL_FINITE: As USER_VEL, but the path does not continue beyond the last step. (One-step paths are considered the same as USER_VEL.)  
 *    The last step is mostly ignored except for time and can be any non-null polygon.
 *    The time interval the path exists is always [t1,t2]
 *  USER_VEL_EVER: As USER_VEL, but the path also continues into the past from the first point (at least to time 0).
 *    The time interval the path exists is always [0,+inf]
 *  
 *  While different modes can mimic many of the same behaviors, there are some internal optimizations when processing certain polygon modes.
 *  For example it is more efficient to use a static polygon than to use a USER_VEL polygon with zero velocity.  Interpolating MORPHING 
 *  polygons also can require more computation than other varieties.
 *  
 * Note: polygon support is experimental and the interface is subject to change!
