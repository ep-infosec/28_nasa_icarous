/**
 * This class implements the core algorithms for conflict detection
 * between an ownship (modeled with a state vector) and a traffic
 * aircraft trajectory (modeled with a intent).  This class assumes
 * all inputs are in internal units.  As such, this class is most
 * appropriate to be part of a larger system, not as a stand-alone
 * conflict detection algorithm.  For that functionality, see the class
 * CDSI.<p>
 *
 * This class can be used two ways: through an object or through a
 * static method.  The static method approach has the advantage that
 * an object does not need to be created.  The object approach has the
 * advantage that more information is available.  Specifically, the
 * start and end times for every conflict are available in the object
 * approach. <p>
 *
 * In addition, for each of these types of use, the aircraft can be
 * specified in two different coordinate systems: a Euclidean space
 * and a latitude and longitude reference frame. <p>
