/**
 * This reads in and stores both Plans and PolyPaths (and parameters) from a file
 * 
 * Plan files consist of comma or space-separated values, with one point per line.
 * Required columns include either:
 * Aircraft name, x-position [nmi], y-position [nmi], z-position [ft], time [s]
 * or
 * Aircraft name, latitude [deg], longitude [deg], altitude [ft], time [s]
 * 
 * Polygon files also include a required second altitude column [ft] (e.g. alt2).
 * 
 * Any given line may contain either type of information, but all lines describing a single entity (either aircraft or polygon)
 * must be located together, and without time decreasing -- new entities are detected by a change in the name field or if
 * (time of entry n) < (time of entry n+1).  The type of the entry is defined by the presence or lack of a second 
 * altitude column value (polys have it, plans don't).
 *
 * Optional columns include point mutability and point label, both with [unspecified] units.  Even if these columns are defined, 
 * these two values are optional for any given line.  Columns without values may be left blank (if comma-delimited) or indicated
 * by a single dash (-).
 *
 * It is necessary to include a header line that defines the column ordering.  The column definitions are not case sensitive.
 * There is also an optional header line, immediately following the column definition, that defines the unit type for each
 * column (the defaults are listed above).
 *
 * If points are consecutive for the same aircraft, subsequent name fields may be replaced with a double quotation mark (").
 * The aircraft name is case sensitive, so US54A != Us54a != us54a.
 *
 * Any empty line or any line starting with a hash sign (#) is ignored.
 *
 * Files may also include parameter definitions prior to other data.  Parameter definitions are of the form <key> = <value>,
 * one per line, where <key> is a case-insensitive alphanumeric word and <value> is either a numeral or string.  The <value> 
 * may include a unit, such as "dist = 50 [m]".  Note that parameters require a space on either side of the equals sign.
 *
 * Parameters can be interpreted as double values, strings, or Boolean values, and the user is required to know which parameter is
 * interpreted as which type.
 * 
 * If the optional parameter "filetype" is specified, its value must be "plan", "trajectory", "poly", or "plan+poly" (no quotes)
 * for this reader to accept the file without error.
 * 
 * Plan "note" information is to be stored with a parameter named ID_note, where ID is the name of the plan in question.
