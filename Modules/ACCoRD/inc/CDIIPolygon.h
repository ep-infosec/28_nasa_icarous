/**
 * This class implements the core algorithms for conflict detection
 * between an ownship and a traffic aircraft trajectory, where both
 * trajectories include intent information.  This class assumes all
 * inputs are in internal units.  As such, this class is most
 * appropriate to be part of a larger system, not as a stand-alone
 * conflict detection algorithm.  For that functionality, see the
 * class CDII.<p>
 *
 * This class can be used two ways: through an object or through a
 * static method.  The static method approach has the advantage that
 * an object does not need to be created.  The object approach has the
 * advantage that more information is available.  Specifically, the
 * start and end times for every conflict are available in the object
 * approach. <p>
 *
 * When using the object method, all method getTimeIn(), etc, assume
 * that the detection() method has been called first.<p>
