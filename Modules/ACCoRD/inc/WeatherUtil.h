	 * Produce a plan that travels between two end points and is approximately conflict free of any polygons.
	 *
	 * (Note this code is experimental and may not always produce correct results.)
	 *
	 * Note:
	 * - "Approximately conflict free" means that there should be no intrusions that are greater than gridSize.  This is intended to be a first step
	 * in a more thorough algorithm to avoid polygons.
	 * - This methods can produce solutions with a small intrusion into one or more polygons (less than 1 gridSize).
	 * These usually happen at acute corners of polygons.  Reducing the grid size will mitigate this (to the reduced grid size).
	 * - If reduceGridPath is true, this is more likely.
	 * - FastPolygonReroute uses an overestimation of polygons.
	 *
	 * @param own   plan for ownship
	 * @param paths polypath collection of polygons to be routed around
	 * @param gridSize approximate size of grid square (in meters)
	 * @param buffer approximate size of extended grid area (in meters)
	 * @param factor weighting for closeness to path (1.0 = approximate distance in grid squares)
	 * @param T_p lookahead time, relative to timeOfCurrentPosition.  Conflicts beyond this time will be ignored, which can cause unexpected behavior.  It is recommended that this be turned off (set to -1) for most cases.
	 * @param fastPolygonReroute,
	 * @param reduceGridPath,		perform a low-level smoothing operation on the resulting path.  this may result in a solution that is not completely conflict free.
	 * @param timeOfCurrentPosition  location of aircraft in its plan
	 * @param reRouteLeadIn          leadin time from current position (wait this amount of time before maneuvar)
	 *
	 * @return new ownship plan (empty and/or error set on fail) and densitygrid used (for visualization)
	 * Note that even a successful return does not guarantee a completely conflict-free return path, only one that does not intrude into any polygons by more than gridSize.
