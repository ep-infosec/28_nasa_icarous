   * This class implements the algorithm for conflict detection
   * between an ownship (modeled with a state vector) and a traffic
   * aircraft trajectory (modeled with intent information).  <p>
   *
   * This class can be used two ways: through an object or through a
   * static method.  The static method approach has the advantage that
   * an object does not need to be created.  The object approach has the
   * advantage that more information is available.  Specifically, the
   * start and end times for every conflict are available in the object
   * approach. <p>
   *
   * In addition, for each of these types of use, the aircraft can be
   * specified in two different coordinate systems: a Euclidean space
   * and a latitude and longitude reference frame. <p>
